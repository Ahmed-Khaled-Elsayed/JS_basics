//Write a script that asks the user to perform the following calculations:

//1)Enter the radius of a circle to calculate and display its area
//2)Enter a number to calculate its square root and show the result in an alert
//3)Enter an angle to calculate its cosine value, then print the result in the console

var radius = prompt("enter circle radius");
var area = Math.PI * radius*radius;
alert("circle area is : "+ area);

var val = prompt("enter value")
alert("square root is :"+Math.sqrt(val));

var deg = prompt("enter angle degree");
var rad = deg*(Math.PI/180);
alert("cos( "+deg+" ) is "+Math.cos(rad));
